# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Laboratory for Component Development

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains in-progress and unstable React components as we develop them.

Labs have started again at version 6.0.0 to signal resurrection of the package after a hiatus; each version of Blueprint Labs will correspond to a major version in the core package. Components may be added, removed, or have their APIs changed at any time without warning. We will communicate changes in the changelog and release notes.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @blueprintjs/labs
```
